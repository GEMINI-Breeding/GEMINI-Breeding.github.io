## Orthomosaic Generation

- After uploading image files to the app, orthomosaic generation can be performed. 
- Expand the dropdown menu of the correct platform and sensor type to select the date to perform generation on. 
- Click the `Start` button to open the orthomosaic generation window. Use the `Previous` and `Next` buttons or the selection bar to iterate through images to mark ground control points (GCPs) as desired (optional).
- When finished marking GCPs, click `Generate Orthophoto`. In the settings dropdown, select the needed orthophoto quality. Note that higher quality selections will increase the generation time. The `Custom` option can be used with OpenDroneMap args if more specific settings are needed. 
- After selecting the quality level, click `Process Images`. Exit the window showing the image frame.
- Follow the progress of the orthomosaic generation by observing the progress bar at the bottom of the page.
