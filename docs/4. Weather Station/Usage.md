## Getting Started
- Connect the USB cable from the Arduino to a 5V power supply.  
- To update the weather station's RTC clock (GMT-0 time zone), turn on the GEMINI App prior to powering the weather station. 
- Depending on your use case, you may either place the weather station in the field to take measurements or attach the unit to the rover.   
- Data from the weather station is stored in the SD Card on the datalogger.
