## **Data Quality Assurance**

- Take a sample recording while driving the Amiga to the field (at the speed you hope to drive the Amiga through the field). 
- View the recording in the file manager app to observe any issues with blur, exposure, occlusion, shadows, or camera position / perspective. 
    - Use the dropdown in the top left to toggle which Oak camera's recording is shown.
- Before beginning recording for the day, use the settings icon in the Camera App to show each camera's output on the display. 
    - Use the *Auto Exposure* and *Auto Focus* buttons to recalibrate each camera if there appears to be an issue.
- Once you have verified that the image quality looks correct, recording can begin once the GPS RTK connection has been made.
